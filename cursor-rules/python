# Project: Python Application

## Coding Standards
- Use Python 3.8+ features
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Employ type hints for all function signatures

## Style Guidelines
- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Max line length: 79 characters
- Use single quotes for strings, except when the string contains a single quote

## Best Practices
- Implement logging using the standard logging library
- Handle exceptions with try-except blocks; log exceptions appropriately
- Write modular and reusable code; avoid code duplication

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functions and classes
- Aim for at least 90% test coverage
- Use pytest as the testing framework

## Documentation
- Use docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions
- Follow the Google style for docstrings
- Maintain an updated README.md with project setup and usage instructions

Remember to consider performance and security in all new features.
